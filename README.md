# koly

The main idea of “koly” is to provide a dynamic issue report for products and product teams. It is a lightweight, fast and productive tool to track all issues of a product that are reported by the team members. **koly** displays all opened issues which can be taken by a team member(s), or can be assigned to a team member(s) by their team leader.

The documentation will be added soon...
