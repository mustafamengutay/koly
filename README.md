# koly

Note: The branch "v2" is under development. Check the "main" branch.

The main idea of “koly” is to provide a dynamic issue report for projects and project teams. It is a lightweight, fast and productive tool to track all issues of a project that are reported by the team members. koly displays all issues which can be adopted by a team member(s), or can be assigned to a team member(s) by their team leader. koly provides features that allow you to manage projects without any learning curve and complexity.
